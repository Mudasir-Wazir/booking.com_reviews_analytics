# Feature Extraction from Booking.com Reviews
This project focuses on extracting meaningful features from unstructured Booking.com reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to clean and preprocess the text data to derive insights that can be used for further analysis or machine learning models.

## Project Overview
The project involves the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Removing stopwords, common words, and special characters.

Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging for processing positive and negative reviews in the form of comments.

Feature Extraction: Identifying and extracting relevant features from the cleaned text data.

## Tools and Libraries Used
NLTK: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stopwords removal, and lemmatization.

Cursor AI: Assisting in code generation and optimization.

The cleaned and preprocessed data can be used for various downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or building recommendation systems.
